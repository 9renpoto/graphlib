h2#Digraph Digraph
:markdown
    The `Digraph` class represents a directed multi-digraph. To use this class
    use `require('graphlib').Digraph`.

h3#Digraph-constructor new Digraph()
:markdown
    Constructs a new empty `Digraph`.

h3#Digraph-order digraph.order()
:markdown
    Returns the number of nodes in the digraph. For example:

    ```js
    var graph = new Digraph();
    digraph.addNode(1);
    digraph.addNode(2);

    digraph.order();
    // => 2
    ```

h3#Digraph-size digraph.size()
:markdown
    Returns the number of edges in the digraph. For example:

    ```js
    var graph = new Digraph();
    digraph.addNode(1);
    digraph.addNode(2);
    digraph.addEdge(null, 1, 2);

    digraph.size();
    // => 1
    ```

h3#Digraph-isDirected digraph.isDirected()
:markdown
    Always returns `true` for `Digraph` because it creates directed graphs.

h3#Digraph-graph digraph.graph([value])
:markdown
    The `graph` function provides a mechansim to get and set some user-defined
    information on the graph object itself. With no arguments `graph` returns
    the currently set value. With one argument `graph` replaces the current
    value on the graph with `value`. The initial value for the graph is
    `undefined`.

    ```js
    var graph = new Digraph();
    digraph.graph();
    // => undefined
    
    digraph.graph("Some graph value");
    digraph.graph();
    // => "Some graph value" 
    ```

h3#Digraph-hasNode digraph.hasNode(u)
:markdown
    Returns `true` if the node with the id `u` is a member of the graph and
    `false` if not.

h3#Digraph-node digraph.node(u, [value])
:markdown
    The `node` function provides a mechanism to get and set some user-defined
    information on an individual node. With one argument this function returns
    the value currently assigned to the node with the id `u`. With two
    arguments this function replaces the current value of the node `u` with
    `value`. The initial value for nodes is `undefined`.

    If there is no node `u` in the graph this function will throw an `Error`.

    ```js
    var graph = new Digraph();
    digraph.addNode(1);
    digraph.node(1);
    // => undefined

    digraph.node(1, "Some node value");
    digraph.node(1);
    // => "Some node value"

    digraph.node(2);
    // throws an Error
    ```

h3#Digraph-nodes digraph.nodes()
:markdown
    Returns the ids of all nodes in this digraph. Use
    [`digraph.node(u)`](#Digraph-node) to get the value for a specific node.

h3#Digraph-eachNode digraph.eachNode(f)
:markdown
    Applies the function `f(id, value)` to each node in the graph in arbitrary
    order.

h3#Digraph-successors digraph.successors(u)
:markdown
    Returns the ids of all nodes that are successors of the node with the id
    `u`. If `u` is not a member of the graph this function throws an `Error`.

h3#Digraph-predecessors digraph.predecessors(u)
:markdown
    Returns the ids of all nodes that are predecessors of the node with the id
    `u`. If `u` is not a member of the graph this function throws an `Error`.

h3#Digraph-neighbors digraph.neighbors(u)
:markdown
    Returns the ids of all nodes that are adjacent to the node with the id `u`.

h3#Digraph-sources digraph.sources()
:markdown
    Returns the ids of all nodes that are in the graph that are sources. A
    source in a directed graph is a node that has no in-edges.

h3#Digraph-sinks digraph.sinks()
:markdown
    Returns the ids of all nodes that are in the graph that are sinks. A
    sink in a directed graph is a node that has no in-edges.

h3#Digraph-hasEdge digraph.hasEdge(e)
:markdown
    Returns `true` if an edge with the id `e` exists in the graph or `false` if
    not.

h3#Digraph-edge digraph.edge(e, [value])
:markdown
    The `edge` function provides a mechanism to get and set some user-defined
    information on an individual edge. With one argument this function returns
    the value currently assigned to the edge with the id `e`. With two
    arguments this function replaces the current value of the edge `e` with
    `value`. The initial value for edges is `undefined`.

    If there is no edge `e` in the graph this function will throw an `Error`.

    ```js
    var graph = new Digraph();
    digraph.addNode(1);
    digraph.addNode(2);
    digraph.edge("A", 1, 2);
    // => undefined

    digraph.edge("A", "Some edge value");
    digraph.edge("A");
    // => "Some edge value"

    digraph.edge("B");
    // throws an Error
    ```

h3#Digraph-edges digraph.edges()
:markdown
    Returns the ids of all edges in this digraph. Use
    [`digraph.edge(e)`](#Digraph-edge) to get the value for a specific edge.

h3#Digraph-eachEdge digraph.eachEdge(f)
:markdown
    Applies the function `f(e, source, target, value)` to each edge in the
    graph in arbitrary order, where `e` is the edge's id, `source` is the id of
    the source node, `target` is the id of the target node, and `value` it the
    value assigned to the edge.

h3#Digraph-source digraph.source(e)
:markdown
    Returns the source node incident on the edge with the id `e`. If no such
    edge exists in the graph this function throws an `Error`.

h3#Digraph-target digraph.target(e)
:markdown
    Returns the target node incident on the edge with the id `e`. If no such
    edge exists in the graph this function throws an `Error`.

h3#Digraph-incidentNodes digraph.incidentNodes(e)
:markdown
    Returns the nodes that are a part of the edge `e` in a 2-element array.
    There is no significance to the order in which the nodes appear in the
    array.

h3#Digraph-inEdges digraph.inEdges(target, [source])
:markdown
    Returns an array of ids for all edges in the graph that have the node
    identified by `target` as their target. If the node `target` is not in the
    graph this function raises an `Error`.

    Optionally a node identified by `source` can be specified. This causes the
    results to be filtered such that only edges pointing from `source` to
    `target` are included. If the node `source` is specified but is not in the
    graph then this function raises an `Error`.

h3#Digraph-outEdges digraph.outEdges(source, [target])
:markdown
    Returns an array of ids for all edges in the graph that have the node
    identified by `source` as their source. If the node `source` is not in the
    graph this function raises an `Error`.

    Optionally a node identified by `target` can be specified. This causes the
    results to be filtered such that only edges pointing from `source` to
    `target` are included. If the node `target` is specified but is not in the
    graph then this function raises an `Error`.

h3#Digraph-incidentEdges digraph.incidentEdges(u, [v])
:markdown
    Returns an arrray of ids for all edges in the graph that are incident on
    the node `u`, regardless of the direction of the edge. If the node `u` is
    not in the graph this function raises an `Error`.

    Optionally the id of another node, `v`, may be be specified. This causes
    the results to be filtered such that only edges between `u` and `v` are
    included in the returned array. If the node `v` is specified but not a
    member of the graph this function raises an `Error`.

h3#Digraph-equals digraph.equals(other)
:markdown
    Returns `true` if `other` has the same set of nodes and edges, and the
    values of those nodes and edges are equal (`===`). Returns `false`
    otherwise.

h3#Digraph-toString digraph.toString()
:markdown
    Returns a `String` representation of this graph for debugging purposes. The
    format of this string is arbitrary and subject to change at any time.

h3#Digraph-addNode digraph.addNode(u, [value])
:markdown
    Adds a new node with the id `u` to the digraph. The node `u` is assigned the
    value of `value` if it is specified. Otherwise it defaults to the value
    `undefined`. If a node with the id `u` is already a member of the graph
    this function throws an `Error`.

h3#Digraph-delNode digraph.delNode(u)
:markdown
    Removes a node from the graph that has the id `u`. Any edges incident on
    the node `u` are also removed. If the graph does not contain a node `u`
    then this function will raise an `Error`.

h3#Digraph-addEdge digraph.addEdge([e], u, v, [value])
:markdown
    Adds a new edge to the graph with the id `e` between a node with the id `u`
    and a node with the id `v`. The edge `e` is assigned the value of `value`
    if it is specified. Otherwise it defaults to the value `undefined`. If `e`
    is `null` the graph will assign an arbitrary id to the edge. This function
    will throw an `Error` if `u` or `v` are not members of this graph or if `e`
    is already a member of this digraph.

h3#Digraph-delEdge digraph.delEdge(e)
:markdown
    Removes an edge in the graph with the id `e`. If no edge in the graph has
    the id `u` this function will thrown an `Error`.
